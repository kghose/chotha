<h1>About</h1>
<p>Chotha is a program to store and organize notes and citations for, primarily, 
academic research. </p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
Most operations are self explanatory, especially with the help in the popup text.
Only the more non-intuitive operations are described here:

<h3>Creating a source</h3>
<p>Type in a pubmed id, a DOI or any other pubmed query into the title box (where
you would otherwise type in the title of the note you are creating). Check the
'this is a paper' checkbox right below that. Type in your notes about the paper
and your keywords as usual. </p>

<p>When you click save, Chotha will save your note as usual, and then will go 
to pubmed, fetch the citation data, create a new citation and link your note to
it.</p>
 
<p>It will then display a citation editing page, where you can review the
citation information. When you click save, the citation information is saved.</p>

<p>If you leave the title blank then a blank citation from will be returned</p>

<p>The program actually fetches the <i>first</i> hit returned by the query. If you
type a pubmed id or a DOI then there is only one hit. If you type a title or 
some other search term, chances are there will be several of which you will get
only the first.</p> 

<p>Chotha is not meant for doing searches on pubmed - only for 
retrieving targeted individual papers at a time.</p>
 
<h3>Links between items</h3>
You can make links to another note or source. To make a link to another note, 
in the text field type <code>[text to link][note:XXX]</code> where XXX is the 
note id. To make a link to a source type in <code>[source:citeykey]</code> 
where citekey is the citekey of the source (e.g. savitzky1964)

<h3>Math text</h3>
Chotha uses Peter Jipsen's <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a> to convert latex strings to equations. Type 
"amath" in a field to activate the relevant javascript so that your text will
be displayed as math when you view it.

<h1>The unauthorized biography of Chotha (চোথা)</h1>
<p><img src="/static/icon.png" title="The icon is based on the Bengali letter 'ch'"/ width="100px" align="right">
The name: Chotha (চোথা) is a Bengali slang word for notes that I picked up when 
I was at Jadavpur University. I believe it is general college slang for 
lecture notes or notes of any kind about a topic. Even my mother knew the word
so I guess it is a fairly polite word that has been in use for some time.</p>

<p>The origins of Chotha were probably the little hanDbase database I created on
my handspring visor (which somebody stole from my office at A.V. Williams building grr.)
This was replaced by R-A which I wrote in C++ and QT and which used MySQl.</p>

<p>I then learned about Rails and migrated R-A to RRiki (written in Ruby, Rails and which 
used MySQL) as a way to procrastinate on writing my thesis.</p>

<p>Then I decided it was getting confusing, in my old age, to write
code in Ruby (This stuff) AND Python (work work) and I was getting ever more 
infatuated with Python, and getting disgruntled by the complexity of Rails and
the upgrading and so on.</p>

<p>Finally, I found Bottle, and over the course of a few weeks, split off the
Diary sub-app and the the main RRiki app into two Python programs that used the
Bottle framework. Chotha is RRiki with the hierarchical keywords replaced by
conjunction keywords and with all that fancy AJAX crap removed. The program
that spanned oh, I don't know, perhaps 40 files, now uses perhaps three files
that I actually like maintaining and looking at.</p>

<p>Rails had its place, but for my simple single user requirements, I think I
will stick to micro-frameworks, and Bottle is just awesome for that</p>
